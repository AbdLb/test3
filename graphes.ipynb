Mbappe could have handled it better but what has Tuchel truly done to warrant his unconditional respect so far? Not much at all.

As hinted I likely am looking into it too much but where my point was how different his body language it is to normal players he handles and how much of a simp he becomes when handling Neymar and Mbappe. I will let you be the judge. And of course it is not a good thing it is merely the way PSG operate. Neymar he has more license to piss off given the French media cannot stand him whereas Mbappe he does have to be careful with given he is the golden child of PSG and the country as a whole.

That sort of behaviour is to be expected with star players who wanna continue in a match. As Sports wrote correctly, most of the time, you leave them to stew in their anger as far as the manager is concerned, the 11 players on the field currently is his immediate concern now.

What is competitive about that?I want to see a video where Ronaldo, neymar or ibra throws a tantrum after being substituted at the 92nd minute, in a Blowout. A game he already scored in. Let\\'s see it.Just look at @sports tryin his absolute best to manufacturing all sorts of stories that doesn\\'t exist just to big up mbappe than he actually is. Yet watch him slander neymar to death if reverse were to be the case.. infact I\\'m beginning to think he\\'s delusional.Btw, how does mbappe work the hardest? Last I checked mbappe is the one who’s come late for trainings and last I checked psg has never allowed Neymar to miss a game for anybody’s birthday. Neymars sisters birthday is in March and he has never made it past February in Paris.And even if neymar is given special privileges, it is because he is that much better simply. When mbappe isn\\'t scoring he isn\\'t impacting the game that much unlike guys like neymar and Messi.Absolute fraud.Contrary to what people think mbappe is closer to inzaghi than a Ronaldo. Even in this particular game he scored and neymar was still the MoM even without scoring any goal.BankzFirst TeamClub Supported :  Posts :  2888Join date :  2014-06-17 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0sportsczy Mon Feb 03, 2020 1:40 amI\\'m not overrating him!

I know that GL is incredibly impulsive and opportunistic, as well as largely hyperbolic in how we view and assess the value or quality of individuals. I would even go so far as to claim that pretty much every single one of us talk out of our asses a lot of the time, because we like to think that we know more than we actually do. That pretentiously omniscient view will probably never change, but I still can’t help but get instigated by it sometimes  About half a decade ago, I vividly remember reading someone on here calling a certain mid-table manager a fraud or whatever, because he fielded a player who was deemed to be useless, over an assumed much better player. I had coincidentally read online that the «much better player» had caught a cold and wasn’t likely to play that day. I wanted to point it out, but then I thought to myself that people on here don’t give a fuck anyway  Firenze is a good example of someone you can call out for making one or several flawed claims, and he’ll just go into trolling mode and start a childish argument instead of owning up to it. That’s part of GL’s charm nowadays, I suppose. Something tells me that most of our members don’t come here to educate themselves about football anymore. Back on the Goal.com forums, that was certainly the case for me.Those impulsive, uneducated observations and arbitrary assessments of who’s great and who needs to have their balls cut off is part of what makes viewing football entertaining, I guess. The truth is usually not as interesting. And I’m sure there are still people on here who think they could do an infinitely better job than that manager. We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but we’re fucking great at ignoring all of those boring, intangible details for the sake of suiting our agendas. I’m sure even Tuchel has his reasons for doing the things he does, and it’s probably not as interesting as him being a beta fraud. These forum tendencies weren’t always present on here to the same extent.

Mbappe could have handled it better but what has Tuchel truly done to warrant his unconditional respect so far? Not much at all.

As hinted I likely am looking into it too much but where my point was how different his body language it is to normal players he handles and how much of a simp he becomes when handling Neymar and Mbappe. I will let you be the judge. And of course it is not a good thing it is merely the way PSG operate. Neymar he has more license to piss off given the French media cannot stand him whereas Mbappe he does have to be careful with given he is the golden child of PSG and the country as a whole.

Mbappe is the only one that has the clout to call them on it.  The Tuchel - Mbappe bridge was burned a long time ago.  It\\'s not going to get fixed.  It has little to do with the subs.

It\\'s more about allowing Neymar and other players from SA to not practice, show up late after vacation, take games off for relatives\\' birthdays, etc.  Mbappe\\'s whole thing is that I\\'m the one who works and practices the hardest out of all these guys, I produce...  yet you sub me out?sportsczyBallon d\\'Or ContenderClub Supported :  Posts :  21477Join date :  2011-12-07 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0Arquitecto Sun Feb 02, 2020 6:31 pmThat does make sense to me now, and glad you clarified that oddity Sports.

That sort of behaviour is to be expected with star players who wanna continue in a match. As Sports wrote correctly, most of the time, you leave them to stew in their anger as far as the manager is concerned, the 11 players on the field currently is his immediate concern now.

What is competitive about that?I want to see a video where Ronaldo, neymar or ibra throws a tantrum after being substituted at the 92nd minute, in a Blowout. A game he already scored in. Let\\'s see it.Just look at @sports tryin his absolute best to manufacturing all sorts of stories that doesn\\'t exist just to big up mbappe than he actually is. Yet watch him slander neymar to death if reverse were to be the case.. infact I\\'m beginning to think he\\'s delusional.Btw, how does mbappe work the hardest? Last I checked mbappe is the one who’s come late for trainings and last I checked psg has never allowed Neymar to miss a game for anybody’s birthday. Neymars sisters birthday is in March and he has never made it past February in Paris.And even if neymar is given special privileges, it is because he is that much better simply. When mbappe isn\\'t scoring he isn\\'t impacting the game that much unlike guys like neymar and Messi.Absolute fraud.Contrary to what people think mbappe is closer to inzaghi than a Ronaldo. Even in this particular game he scored and neymar was still the MoM even without scoring any goal.BankzFirst TeamClub Supported :  Posts :  2888Join date :  2014-06-17 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0sportsczy Mon Feb 03, 2020 1:40 amI\\'m not overrating him!

I know that GL is incredibly impulsive and opportunistic, as well as largely hyperbolic in how we view and assess the value or quality of individuals. I would even go so far as to claim that pretty much every single one of us talk out of our asses a lot of the time, because we like to think that we know more than we actually do. That pretentiously omniscient view will probably never change, but I still can’t help but get instigated by it sometimes  About half a decade ago, I vividly remember reading someone on here calling a certain mid-table manager a fraud or whatever, because he fielded a player who was deemed to be useless, over an assumed much better player. I had coincidentally read online that the «much better player» had caught a cold and wasn’t likely to play that day. I wanted to point it out, but then I thought to myself that people on here don’t give a fuck anyway  Firenze is a good example of someone you can call out for making one or several flawed claims, and he’ll just go into trolling mode and start a childish argument instead of owning up to it. That’s part of GL’s charm nowadays, I suppose. Something tells me that most of our members don’t come here to educate themselves about football anymore. Back on the Goal.com forums, that was certainly the case for me.Those impulsive, uneducated observations and arbitrary assessments of who’s great and who needs to have their balls cut off is part of what makes viewing football entertaining, I guess. The truth is usually not as interesting. And I’m sure there are still people on here who think they could do an infinitely better job than that manager. We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but we’re fucking great at ignoring all of those boring, intangible details for the sake of suiting our agendas. I’m sure even Tuchel has his reasons for doing the things he does, and it’s probably not as interesting as him being a beta fraud. These forum tendencies weren’t always present on here to the same extent.

As hinted I likely am looking into it too much but where my point was how different his body language it is to normal players he handles and how much of a simp he becomes when handling Neymar and Mbappe. I will let you be the judge. And of course it is not a good thing it is merely the way PSG operate. Neymar he has more license to piss off given the French media cannot stand him whereas Mbappe he does have to be careful with given he is the golden child of PSG and the country as a whole.

That sort of behaviour is to be expected with star players who wanna continue in a match.

What is competitive about that?I want to see a video where Ronaldo, neymar or ibra throws a tantrum after being substituted at the 92nd minute, in a Blowout. A game he already scored in. Let\\'s see it.Just look at @sports tryin his absolute best to manufacturing all sorts of stories that doesn\\'t exist just to big up mbappe than he actually is. Yet watch him slander neymar to death if reverse were to be the case.. infact I\\'m beginning to think he\\'s delusional.Btw, how does mbappe work the hardest? Last I checked mbappe is the one who’s come late for trainings and last I checked psg has never allowed Neymar to miss a game for anybody’s birthday. Neymars sisters birthday is in March and he has never made it past February in Paris.And even if neymar is given special privileges, it is because he is that much better simply. When mbappe isn\\'t scoring he isn\\'t impacting the game that much unlike guys like neymar and Messi.Absolute fraud.Contrary to what people think mbappe is closer to inzaghi than a Ronaldo. Even in this particular game he scored and neymar was still the MoM even without scoring any goal.BankzFirst TeamClub Supported :  Posts :  2888Join date :  2014-06-17 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0sportsczy Mon Feb 03, 2020 1:40 amI\\'m not overrating him!

I know that GL is incredibly impulsive and opportunistic, as well as largely hyperbolic in how we view and assess the value or quality of individuals. I would even go so far as to claim that pretty much every single one of us talk out of our asses a lot of the time, because we like to think that we know more than we actually do. That pretentiously omniscient view will probably never change, but I still can’t help but get instigated by it sometimes  About half a decade ago, I vividly remember reading someone on here calling a certain mid-table manager a fraud or whatever, because he fielded a player who was deemed to be useless, over an assumed much better player. I had coincidentally read online that the «much better player» had caught a cold and wasn’t likely to play that day. I wanted to point it out, but then I thought to myself that people on here don’t give a fuck anyway  Firenze is a good example of someone you can call out for making one or several flawed claims, and he’ll just go into trolling mode and start a childish argument instead of owning up to it. That’s part of GL’s charm nowadays, I suppose. Something tells me that most of our members don’t come here to educate themselves about football anymore. Back on the Goal.com forums, that was certainly the case for me.Those impulsive, uneducated observations and arbitrary assessments of who’s great and who needs to have their balls cut off is part of what makes viewing football entertaining, I guess. The truth is usually not as interesting. And I’m sure there are still people on here who think they could do an infinitely better job than that manager. We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but we’re fucking great at ignoring all of those boring, intangible details for the sake of suiting our agendas. I’m sure even Tuchel has his reasons for doing the things he does, and it’s probably not as interesting as him being a beta fraud. These forum tendencies weren’t always present on here to the same extent.

See how SAF, Klopp, etc. walk away from the confrontation when they see that CR, etc. are annoyed for being subbed. \\xa0They don\\'t hold the player back and try to engage in a conversation.Just ridiculous. \\xa0The kid is pissed off and isn\\'t looking for anything other than going to the bench. \\xa0He\\'s not talking or moving towards the manager. \\xa0He\\'s trying to leave.This whole thing is manufactured by Tuchel.I had the idea that Tuchel was a very ruthless personality but video evidence like this that goes beyond this sample is rather laughable. Nothing is more embarrassing for a manager to chase after the approval of a disgruntled player substituted for whatever reason.Never seen anything like this from Zidane, Carletto, Pep or Heynkces.To the usual \"he should show respect!\" brigade simply don\\'t know the mentality of superstars and how painful it is to plant themselves on the bench. Mbappe could have handled it better but what has Tuchel truly done to warrant his unconditional respect so far? Not much at all.

As hinted I likely am looking into it too much but where my point was how different his body language it is to normal players he handles and how much of a simp he becomes when handling Neymar and Mbappe. I will let you be the judge. And of course it is not a good thing it is merely the way PSG operate. Neymar he has more license to piss off given the French media cannot stand him whereas Mbappe he does have to be careful with given he is the golden child of PSG and the country as a whole.

That sort of behaviour is to be expected with star players who wanna continue in a match. As Sports wrote correctly, most of the time, you leave them to stew in their anger as far as the manager is concerned, the 11 players on the field currently is his immediate concern now.

It may well be that this French liga is a step below some others but this kid has put up impressive numbers in WC and CL. If one (non biased) puts forth the top 5 players right now, Messi, Neymar, possibly still Ronaldo, and Mbappe would be on that list.There is a lot of things wrong at PSG, but the talent of its two stars is not amongst them.This episode is being blown way out of proportion and if there is anything wrong that lies with the coach!futbol_billFan FavoriteClub Supported :  Posts :  6971Join date :  2011-06-05 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0Myesyats Mon Feb 03, 2020 12:53 amSports overrates Mbappe and we underrate him in return.

What is competitive about that?I want to see a video where Ronaldo, neymar or ibra throws a tantrum after being substituted at the 92nd minute, in a Blowout. A game he already scored in. Let\\'s see it.Just look at @sports tryin his absolute best to manufacturing all sorts of stories that doesn\\'t exist just to big up mbappe than he actually is. Yet watch him slander neymar to death if reverse were to be the case.. infact I\\'m beginning to think he\\'s delusional.Btw, how does mbappe work the hardest? Last I checked mbappe is the one who’s come late for trainings and last I checked psg has never allowed Neymar to miss a game for anybody’s birthday. Neymars sisters birthday is in March and he has never made it past February in Paris.And even if neymar is given special privileges, it is because he is that much better simply. When mbappe isn\\'t scoring he isn\\'t impacting the game that much unlike guys like neymar and Messi.Absolute fraud.Contrary to what people think mbappe is closer to inzaghi than a Ronaldo. Even in this particular game he scored and neymar was still the MoM even without scoring any goal.BankzFirst TeamClub Supported :  Posts :  2888Join date :  2014-06-17 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0sportsczy Mon Feb 03, 2020 1:40 amI\\'m not overrating him!

I know that GL is incredibly impulsive and opportunistic, as well as largely hyperbolic in how we view and assess the value or quality of individuals. I would even go so far as to claim that pretty much every single one of us talk out of our asses a lot of the time, because we like to think that we know more than we actually do. That pretentiously omniscient view will probably never change, but I still can’t help but get instigated by it sometimes  About half a decade ago, I vividly remember reading someone on here calling a certain mid-table manager a fraud or whatever, because he fielded a player who was deemed to be useless, over an assumed much better player. I had coincidentally read online that the «much better player» had caught a cold and wasn’t likely to play that day. I wanted to point it out, but then I thought to myself that people on here don’t give a fuck anyway  Firenze is a good example of someone you can call out for making one or several flawed claims, and he’ll just go into trolling mode and start a childish argument instead of owning up to it. That’s part of GL’s charm nowadays, I suppose. Something tells me that most of our members don’t come here to educate themselves about football anymore. Back on the Goal.com forums, that was certainly the case for me.Those impulsive, uneducated observations and arbitrary assessments of who’s great and who needs to have their balls cut off is part of what makes viewing football entertaining, I guess. The truth is usually not as interesting. And I’m sure there are still people on here who think they could do an infinitely better job than that manager. We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but we’re fucking great at ignoring all of those boring, intangible details for the sake of suiting our agendas. I’m sure even Tuchel has his reasons for doing the things he does, and it’s probably not as interesting as him being a beta fraud. These forum tendencies weren’t always present on here to the same extent.

As hinted I likely am looking into it too much but where my point was how different his body language it is to normal players he handles and how much of a simp he becomes when handling Neymar and Mbappe. I will let you be the judge. And of course it is not a good thing it is merely the way PSG operate. Neymar he has more license to piss off given the French media cannot stand him whereas Mbappe he does have to be careful with given he is the golden child of PSG and the country as a whole.

That sort of behaviour is to be expected with star players who wanna continue in a match.

What is competitive about that?I want to see a video where Ronaldo, neymar or ibra throws a tantrum after being substituted at the 92nd minute, in a Blowout. A game he already scored in. Let\\'s see it.Just look at @sports tryin his absolute best to manufacturing all sorts of stories that doesn\\'t exist just to big up mbappe than he actually is. Yet watch him slander neymar to death if reverse were to be the case.. infact I\\'m beginning to think he\\'s delusional.Btw, how does mbappe work the hardest? Last I checked mbappe is the one who’s come late for trainings and last I checked psg has never allowed Neymar to miss a game for anybody’s birthday. Neymars sisters birthday is in March and he has never made it past February in Paris.And even if neymar is given special privileges, it is because he is that much better simply. When mbappe isn\\'t scoring he isn\\'t impacting the game that much unlike guys like neymar and Messi.Absolute fraud.Contrary to what people think mbappe is closer to inzaghi than a Ronaldo. Even in this particular game he scored and neymar was still the MoM even without scoring any goal.BankzFirst TeamClub Supported :  Posts :  2888Join date :  2014-06-17 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0sportsczy Mon Feb 03, 2020 1:40 amI\\'m not overrating him!

The truth lies between us somewhere, as it usually does. But there needs to be balance in nature and also according to the GL holy manuscript of truth. You should read it.You know who doesn\\'t get this: Thimmy and he\\'s been here since goal.com ffs.GL Holy Manuscript of Truth is binding. I know that GL is incredibly impulsive and opportunistic, as well as largely hyperbolic in how we view and assess the value or quality of individuals. I would even go so far as to claim that pretty much every single one of us talk out of our asses a lot of the time, because we like to think that we know more than we actually do. That pretentiously omniscient view will probably never change, but I still can’t help but get instigated by it sometimes  About half a decade ago, I vividly remember reading someone on here calling a certain mid-table manager a fraud or whatever, because he fielded a player who was deemed to be useless, over an assumed much better player. I had coincidentally read online that the «much better player» had caught a cold and wasn’t likely to play that day. I wanted to point it out, but then I thought to myself that people on here don’t give a fuck anyway  Firenze is a good example of someone you can call out for making one or several flawed claims, and he’ll just go into trolling mode and start a childish argument instead of owning up to it. That’s part of GL’s charm nowadays, I suppose. Something tells me that most of our members don’t come here to educate themselves about football anymore. Back on the Goal.com forums, that was certainly the case for me.Those impulsive, uneducated observations and arbitrary assessments of who’s great and who needs to have their balls cut off is part of what makes viewing football entertaining, I guess. The truth is usually not as interesting. And I’m sure there are still people on here who think they could do an infinitely better job than that manager. We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but we’re fucking great at ignoring all of those boring, intangible details for the sake of suiting our agendas. I’m sure even Tuchel has his reasons for doing the things he does, and it’s probably not as interesting as him being a beta fraud. These forum tendencies weren’t always present on here to the same extent.

Mbappe could have handled it better but what has Tuchel truly done to warrant his unconditional respect so far? Not much at all.

As hinted I likely am looking into it too much but where my point was how different his body language it is to normal players he handles and how much of a simp he becomes when handling Neymar and Mbappe. I will let you be the judge. And of course it is not a good thing it is merely the way PSG operate. Neymar he has more license to piss off given the French media cannot stand him whereas Mbappe he does have to be careful with given he is the golden child of PSG and the country as a whole.

Mbappe is the only one that has the clout to call them on it.  The Tuchel - Mbappe bridge was burned a long time ago.  It\\'s not going to get fixed.  It has little to do with the subs.

It\\'s more about allowing Neymar and other players from SA to not practice, show up late after vacation, take games off for relatives\\' birthdays, etc.  Mbappe\\'s whole thing is that I\\'m the one who works and practices the hardest out of all these guys, I produce...  yet you sub me out?sportsczyBallon d\\'Or ContenderClub Supported :  Posts :  21477Join date :  2011-12-07 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0Arquitecto Sun Feb 02, 2020 6:31 pmThat does make sense to me now, and glad you clarified that oddity Sports.

That sort of behaviour is to be expected with star players who wanna continue in a match. As Sports wrote correctly, most of the time, you leave them to stew in their anger as far as the manager is concerned, the 11 players on the field currently is his immediate concern now.

It may well be that this French liga is a step below some others but this kid has put up impressive numbers in WC and CL. If one (non biased) puts forth the top 5 players right now, Messi, Neymar, possibly still Ronaldo, and Mbappe would be on that list.There is a lot of things wrong at PSG, but the talent of its two stars is not amongst them.This episode is being blown way out of proportion and if there is anything wrong that lies with the coach!futbol_billFan FavoriteClub Supported :  Posts :  6971Join date :  2011-06-05 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0Myesyats Mon Feb 03, 2020 12:53 amSports overrates Mbappe and we underrate him in return.

What is competitive about that?I want to see a video where Ronaldo, neymar or ibra throws a tantrum after being substituted at the 92nd minute, in a Blowout. A game he already scored in. Let\\'s see it.Just look at @sports tryin his absolute best to manufacturing all sorts of stories that doesn\\'t exist just to big up mbappe than he actually is. Yet watch him slander neymar to death if reverse were to be the case.. infact I\\'m beginning to think he\\'s delusional.Btw, how does mbappe work the hardest? Last I checked mbappe is the one who’s come late for trainings and last I checked psg has never allowed Neymar to miss a game for anybody’s birthday. Neymars sisters birthday is in March and he has never made it past February in Paris.And even if neymar is given special privileges, it is because he is that much better simply. When mbappe isn\\'t scoring he isn\\'t impacting the game that much unlike guys like neymar and Messi.Absolute fraud.Contrary to what people think mbappe is closer to inzaghi than a Ronaldo. Even in this particular game he scored and neymar was still the MoM even without scoring any goal.BankzFirst TeamClub Supported :  Posts :  2888Join date :  2014-06-17 \\xa0 Re: Mbappe is the biggest fraud in football today.\\xa0by\\xa0sportsczy Mon Feb 03, 2020 1:40 amI\\'m not overrating him!

I know that GL is incredibly impulsive and opportunistic, as well as largely hyperbolic in how we view and assess the value or quality of individuals. I would even go so far as to claim that pretty much every single one of us talk out of our asses a lot of the time, because we like to think that we know more than we actually do. That pretentiously omniscient view will probably never change, but I still can’t help but get instigated by it sometimes  About half a decade ago, I vividly remember reading someone on here calling a certain mid-table manager a fraud or whatever, because he fielded a player who was deemed to be useless, over an assumed much better player. I had coincidentally read online that the «much better player» had caught a cold and wasn’t likely to play that day. I wanted to point it out, but then I thought to myself that people on here don’t give a fuck anyway  Firenze is a good example of someone you can call out for making one or several flawed claims, and he’ll just go into trolling mode and start a childish argument instead of owning up to it. That’s part of GL’s charm nowadays, I suppose. Something tells me that most of our members don’t come here to educate themselves about football anymore. Back on the Goal.com forums, that was certainly the case for me.Those impulsive, uneducated observations and arbitrary assessments of who’s great and who needs to have their balls cut off is part of what makes viewing football entertaining, I guess. The truth is usually not as interesting. And I’m sure there are still people on here who think they could do an infinitely better job than that manager. We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but we’re fucking great at ignoring all of those boring, intangible details for the sake of suiting our agendas. I’m sure even Tuchel has his reasons for doing the things he does, and it’s probably not as interesting as him being a beta fraud. These forum tendencies weren’t always present on here to the same extent.

      "As a KYC (Know Your Customer) professional, I have reviewed the provided report and have the following feedback:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall Assessment:\n",
      "The current report is mostly complete, but there are a few areas that could be improved to align with best practices for KYC compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "1. The report includes essential customer information such as full name, date of birth, and address.\n",
      "2. The report provides details on the customer's occupation and income sources, which is crucial for assessing their financial profile.\n",
      "3. The report includes information on the customer's account activity and transaction history, which is essential for monitoring and detecting any suspicious activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "1. Identification and Verification:\n",
      "   - The report should include clear documentation (e.g., copies of government-issued ID, utility bills) to verify the customer's identity and address.\n",
      "   - Additional steps could be taken to further validate the customer's identity, such as conducting a thorough background check or using biometric identification methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Risk Assessment:\n",
      "   - The report should include a more comprehensive risk assessment, considering factors such as the customer's geographic location, industry, and potential exposure to money laundering or other financial crimes.\n",
      "   - It would be helpful to include information on the customer's political affiliations, if any, as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) may pose a higher risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sanctions and Watchlist Screening:\n",
      "   - The report should include the results of screening the customer against relevant sanctions lists, such as those maintained by the United Nations, the European Union, or national authorities.\n",
      "   - Screening for potential involvement in fraudulent activities or other financial crimes should also be conducted and documented in the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Ongoing Monitoring:\n",
      "   - The report should outline the process and frequency for ongoing monitoring of the customer's activities, including any triggers or thresholds that would prompt further investigation or reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Regulatory and Compliance:\n",
      "   - The report should reference the relevant regulatory requirements and guidelines that have been considered and followed in the KYC process.\n",
      "   - It would be helpful to include any specific regulatory or industry-specific requirements that apply to the customer's business or industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional Considerations:\n",
      "Depending on the nature of the customer's business and the industry they operate in, the KYC report may need to include additional information, such as:\n",
      "- Details on the customer's beneficial owners or significant shareholders\n",
      "- Information on the customer's suppliers, business partners, or other third-party relationships\n",
      "- Any potential involvement in high-risk or heavily regulated industries (e.g., gambling, cryptocurrency, firearms)\n",
      "- Documentation of any enhanced due diligence measures taken, such as on-site visits or interviews with the customer\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the current report is generally comprehensive, but there are opportunities to strengthen the KYC process and ensure compliance with best practices and regulatory requirements. Addressing the areas for improvement outlined above will help to provide a more robust and comprehensive KYC report.\n"
